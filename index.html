    <section id="reason">
        <h2>Why I Joined AltSchool</h2>
        <p>My decision to join AltSchoolAfrica was influenced by my drive to continually seek for knowledge. Being
            friends with a previous graduate from the program, I was fascinated by how wide and well detailed ther
            curriculum was. As an aspiring backed developer, I believed that this program offers me grounded knowledge
            in not just the fundamentals but also skills that would be difficult to attain when self-learning. Also the
            prospect of knowing today and tomorrows top tech monguls as well as the interaction with fellow peers is
            something that I would not want to pass </p>

            general and a core understanding of backend development principles, and
            acquire new technical skills. Additionally, I am looking forward to the forming meaningful connections with
            my peers.</p>
